"The number of refugee returns to Ukraine is estimated using the IOM DTM data Round 13. The report estimates that 861,000 refugees have returned for three months or more, which may (in light of the high frequency of pendular movements between Ukraine and host countries) indicate an intention for a stable return. Of these 158,000 have returned for between 3 and 6 months and are reported in 2023 statistics, while 703,000 returned more than 6 months ago and are reported retroactively in 2022. In addition, 353,000 refugees have returned to locations in Ukraine that are not their place of origin. UNHCR estimates that 39,000 of them returned in the first six months of 2023, with 314,000 having returned in 2022.",2023,UKR,,RET
